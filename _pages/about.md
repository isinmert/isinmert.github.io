# About Me
* I am a PhD student at Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics Department at UT Austin.
* My Research interests lies in stochastic optimal control and trajectory optimization problems in uncertain, safety critical systems.
* I obtained by BS degree on Mechanical Engineering from Bogazici University graduating with the highest GPA (3.89) among 70 students.

I am a PhD student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin with a special focus on Control Theory, Autonomous Systems, and Robotics.
My research interests lie in the theory and applications of stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning for uncertain, safety-critical systems.
My current research specifically focuses on density steering problems for dynamical systems which uses the theory of optimization and optimal mass transport.
<!-- My goal is to expand the knowledge on stochastic controls, motion planning, and probabilistic trajectory optimization into real-world problems where randomness is ubiquitous and safety is utterly important.  -->
Prior to joining UT for my PhD studies, I obtained my BS degree on Mechanical Engineering from Bogazici University graduating with the highest GPA (3.89/4.0) among 70 students.
